Firmware: Software that you don't write

1. What is the role of a flight controller in a drone system, and how does it differ from an onboard computer (like a Jetson)?
	- Flight Controller:
		- Acts like autonomic nervous system in body
		- Uses sensors to maintain drone stability
		- Not autonomous, relies of external commands
		- Processes radio inputs and executes control loops
		- Communicates via protocols like MAVLink
	- Onboard Computer (NVIDIA Jetson):
		- Functions like the somatic nervous system
		- Handles more high-level tasks like computer vision, path planning, and autonomy
		- Runs ROS, object detection, etc.
		- Sends commands to Flight Controller
		- Connects via Serial, Ethernet, or USB
    
2. What sensors are typically connected to a flight controller?
	- IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
		- Uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration
			- Used for drone stabilization
		- Many times is combined with magnetometers for heading estimation
	- Barometers
		- Measures air pressure, used to control altitude
	- Magnetometer
		- Detects Earth's magnetic field to determine heading
		- Corrects yaw drift and supports navigation in GPS denied environments
	- GPS module
		- Provides global position (because we can't integrate accelerometer data), velocity, and time data
			- Uses satellites to do so, and RTK-real time kinematics (but satellite signals can be blocked)
			- Each satellite gives a distance between it and you, and you can use triangulation to get a good read on where you are located
		- Enables waypoint navigation, return-to-home, and geofencing
		- Magnetic declination: difference in angle between true north and magnetic north
	- Drone Cameras
		- Standard RGB cameras
			- Can send optical data to both FC and jetson (onboard computers generally)
			- Full color images and video used for mapping/inspection/aerial photography
			- Usually mounted on a gimbal for stabilized footage
				- The gimbal can also be controlled (has around 3 servos) through the firmware
		- What to consider when looking at cameras?
			- Sensor size, resolution, field of view, frame rate, dynamic range, interface type, and digital vs optical zoom
	- RC Transmitters and Receivers
		- RC Transmitter (TX)
			- Communicates wirelessly with receiver on drone via radio protocols (2.4 GHz radio)
		- RC Receiver (RX)
			- Mounted on drone, receives signals from transmitter
			- Old versions of signal transmission methods used the width of pulses

3. What are the key communication protocols between flight controllers and peripherals (e.g. I2C, CAN, MAVLink)?
	- Serial (UART)
		- Direct, basic communication channel between exactly 2 devices
		- Used for communication between FC and onboard computer, GPS modules, telemetry radios
		- Simple 2-wire setup: TX and RX
		- Each UART connection has its own set of wires
		- Common for MAVLink messages and debugging
	- CAN (Controller Area Network)
		- Used a lot on cars
		- Similar to a device "group chat"
		- Robust, multi-device protocol used in high end drones
		- Great for unpredictable environments and long cable runs
		- Used for smart ESCs, gimbals, advanced sensor networks
		- Has error checking to prevent miscommunication
	- I2C / SPI (electronic heavy protocol)
		- I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
			- Used for low speed communication with devices like barometers, magnetometers, and IMUs
			- Shares two wires: SDA (data) and SCL (clock)
				- Clock is extremely important for interval checking and keeping everything in line
					- Sends pulse very consistently and everything else reads it and knows when to send data based on that pulse
		- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
			- Same as serial/UART but for multiple devices listening to one "master" device
			- Uses a high speed clock and is suitable for higher data rates
			- Four signals are:
				- SCLK
				- MOSI
				- MISO
				- CS
	- MAVLink
		- Micro Air Vehicle Link
			- "Drone Language" for commands and telemetry
			- Not an actual protocol, it's a message format that runs over Serial, UDP, or CAN
			- Used to send commands (like takeoff) and receive data
			- Powers communication between flight controller and onboard computer or ground station
			- Kind of like when you inspect element and there are a bunch of "tags"
	- DDS (Data Distribution System)
		- Kind of like MAVLink but used inside the drone itself
		- Communication protocol used by ROS 2 and modern drone systems
		- Has real-time publish-subscribe messaging between modules <- important
		- Very fast
		- Powers direct connection between flight controllers and onboard computers
		- Great for real-time performance (control loops for example)
		- Over UART connection
	- Common Setup
		- MAVLink
			- Communicates with ground station over UDP
		- DDS: Communicates between flight controller and onboard computer
    
4. How does firmware (e.g. Betaflight) influence the capabilities of the flight controller?
	- FC firmware
		- Low level software that runs on drone that we don't develop
		- Ardupilot, Betaflight, PX4 are examples
		- Firmware can be configured to optimize your flight characteristics
			- big/small drone, fast/slow
		- Has different flight modes (auto-stabilize, full stick control)
	- PID Control (Proportional Integral Derivative)
		- Used to control drone pitch over time
		- Critical damping
			- System returns to equilibrium position in shortest time possible without oscillating
