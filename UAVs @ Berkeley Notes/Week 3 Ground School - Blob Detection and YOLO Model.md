1. What is Blob Detection?
	- Good for detecting objects if you have a uniform background
	- Bad if there's a lot of variation
	-  Laplacian of Gaussian
		- 1st: Gaussian blur
			- Preprocessing step
			- Convolution with Gaussian kernel
				- What's a kernel?
					- Small matrix used to transform a larger image (transformation is just multiple dot products)
				- The Gaussian kernel basically just takes a weighted average of multiple pixel values to blur the image
			- Reduces noise before Laplacian
		- 2nd: Laplacian
			- Second order derivative in each direction (x,y)
			- Used for edge detection (at 0 crossings)
	- It is possible to filter blobs based on certain criteria/thresholds
2. YOLO Model + ML
	- Linear Classifier + Perceptron
		- Based on Biological Neurons
		- Most simple classifier, classifies data into binary clusters
	- If there are more than 2 possibilities:
		- Instead of outputting a single value, we have a set of weight vectors for each possibility
		- Then we use an activation function to obtain a probability for each outcome
	- Deep Neural Networks
		- Adds hidden layers and nonlinear activation functions which allow us to infer on more complex relationships
		- Common activation functions
			- Sigmoid
			- Hyperbolic
			- ReLU
			- These introduce nonlinearity in terms of prediction probabilities
		- Each 'epoch,' we update the weights of our function to improve the model's loss
			- The way we compute our weights is using gradients (weights = grad f * learning rate (f is the loss function))
				- Gradient is the vector made up of directional derivatives
				- Direction of gradient is maximal ascent
	- How to make our Neural Network better?
		- Play around with adding more nodes, layers, changing activation function
		- Train with more data
		- Add convolutions/pooling
			- Convolutions: Learned kernels that can extract patterns
			- Max Pooling: Reduces dimensionality, lessens overfitting, noise reduction
	- How does YOLO work?
		- It's a one shot CNN
			- One pass of the input image to make prediction, making it less accurate but faster
			- The alternative is two passes of the input image to make a predictions (first shot is used to propose object locations)
		- The architecture is made up of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and a ReLU activation function
		- To train a YOLO model, we need to decide on train/validation/test data splits
			- Train data unsurprisingly is used to train the model
			- Validation data helps you make decisions on how to tune hyperparameters
			- Test data is not touched until very end to evaluate how good the model is
			- A 70/20/10 is standard
		- One problem with such models is overfitting (fitting exactly to your given data and not generalizing)
3. Why care about how all these models work?
	- Because we want to be able to play around with the idea of creating our own custom models and not just use prebuilt ones
	- This would allow us to have our models be more specific to our tasks, and it gets us creativity points
